## üìÅ Repository Structure

### `matrix_vector_warp/`

Experiments involving warp-level operations and matrix-vector multiplications.

- `include/`
  - `utils.cuh`: Utility functions for warp-level operations.
  - `warp_op.cuh`: Warp-specific operation headers.
- `kernel/`
  - `warp_op.cu`: CUDA implementation of warp-level operations.
  - `main.cu`: Driver code to execute the warp-based matrix-vector operation.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for the warp-level module.
